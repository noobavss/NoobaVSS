#NoobaVSS Video Surveillance System

NoobaVSS is a free and open source smart video surveillance system. It is based on Qt C++ and use OpenCV for image processing.

Main Purpose of this project is to provide an application platform to develop video surveillance related algorithms quickly and easily. Even though NoobaVSS is designed to be a video surveillance system this can be used as a plug-in based video processing application.

[NoobaVSS](https://noobavss.github.io/) is the main platform which serves plug-ins, and provides user interface.

##NoobaVSS Plug-ins
Nooba plug-ins are the building blocks of this system. These plug-ins can be inter connected to detect different types of anomalies. You can create your own plug-ins to suite your needs. We have built a set of plug-ins to get you started.
